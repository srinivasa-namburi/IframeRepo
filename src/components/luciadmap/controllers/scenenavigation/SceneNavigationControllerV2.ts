/**
 * Navigation controller meant to look at 3D objects from close-by, while visualizing navigational anchor points with
 * 3D gizmos. Using this controller, users can interact with the map in the following ways:
 *
 * Use of this controller allows the following interactions:
 * - Panning orthogonally to the camera's forward direction with left mouse drags or one finger touch drags
 * - Rotating around an anchor under your mouse with right mouse drags or two finger touch drags
 * - Rotating around the camera eye with left + right mouse drags or the normal rotation controls with ctrl pressed, or
 *   with normal rotation controls if `NavigationKeysMode.CAMERA_FORWARD` is set.
 * - Zooming in to and away from an anchor under your mouse with the scroll wheel or pinch gestures.
 * - Zooming in on a clicked point, when both `useZoomAnimations` and `allowZoomOnClick` are enabled.
 * - Move horizontally relative to the earth's surface with the arrow or WASD keys (or corresponding keys if you don't
 *   have a QWERTY keyboard) when using `NavigationKeysMode.TANGENT_FORWARD`, or relative to the camera's forward and
 *   right vector with `NavigationKeysMode.CAMERA_FORWARD`.
 * - Move vertically relative to the earth's surface with the Q and E keys (or corresponding keys if you don't have a
 *   QWERTY keyboard) when using `NavigationKeysMode.TANGENT_FORWARD`, or relative to the camera's up direction with
 *   `NavigationKeysMode.CAMERA_FORWARD`.
 *
 * For zooming behaviour, one can set `useZoomAnimations` to `true` to smoothly animate the zooming by a predetermined
 * percentage as opposed to increments based on the zoom amount determined by the gesture (scroll wheel or pinch).
 *
 * This controller also guarantees that when it moves the camera, it will always stay in the given bounds. The center of
 * the given bounds is also used to calculate the interaction anchors if none could be found under or close to the mouse
 * position.
 *
 * Note that you _must_ specify a bounds to the constructor that is large enough to encompass the asset that you want
 * to navigate around in; if the bounds do not fit around your asset, you are not able to move around in the asset.
 *
 * When working with georeferenced data, note that the bounds should typically be in a topocentric reference, so that
 * they're aligned with the earth surface. This is unlike geocentric (EPSG:4978) bounds, which often stick slanted
 * through the surface. If you _do_ pass in geocentric bounds, these will automatically be converted to a topocentric
 * reference.
 *
 * This controller only works with a PerspectiveCamera.
